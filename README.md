# binlist
## Gathering data from binlist.net


This is the only one script file (C#) for linqpad.

In order to use it you will need to:
 1. create a table inside Sql Server database (or replace it with List<> for example) for gathered results
 2. create a view in order to get a list of bins you need to get information about - definitely could replace it with List<> again


And... that's all.
